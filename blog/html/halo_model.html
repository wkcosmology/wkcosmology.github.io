<p>Large galaxy surveys reveal the inhomogeneity of our Universe in a sense that
galaxies are spatially clustered, rather than uniformly distributed. This
inhomogeneity originates from the small density fluctuation in our primordial
Universe, which is then amplified by gravity. On the other side, our Universe
comprises 70% dark energy, 25% dark matter, and 5% baryon. And since dark energy
is believed to be absolutely uniform in our current understanding, the
inhomogeneity in our Universe is from dark matter and baryon.</p>
<h1 id="the-formation-of-halos-and-galaxies">The formation of halos and galaxies</h1>
<p>The final state that an over-dense region can be amplified is a virialized
structure called dark matter halo, when the pressure from the random motion of
dark matter particles equilibrate the attracting gravity. These dark matter
halos are the basic "elements" that compose the large-scale structure in our
Universe. The final virial equilibrium state can be reached since dark matter
cannot emit these kinetic energy away through electromagnetic radiation, which
can be done for baryons. When the inhomogeneity is not so large, baryons
basically follow the dark matter. However, when the inhomogeneity becomes large
enough, baryons in over-dense regions will collide with each other and excite
the electron to higher energy states, which will then decay to the ground level
and emit a photo. Through this process, baryons can emit their energy away and
keep collapsing. Formally speaking, this difference between dark matter and
baryon is due to that the former is "collisionless" while the latter is
"collisional".</p>
<p>After emitting their energy away through radiation, baryons can collapse into
smaller scales and reach higher kinetic energy, i.e. higher temperature.
Eventually, the nuclei reaction can be triggered and stars are formed. Stars,
unlike gaseous baryons, are collisionless, so they can also reach the final
state of virial equilibrium. And the assemble of these stars is called a
galaxy.</p>

<p>The above narrative draws a simple picture for halo formation and galaxy
formation for an isolated system. However, halos and galaxies are interacting
with each other.</p>
