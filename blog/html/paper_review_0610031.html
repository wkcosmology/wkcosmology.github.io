            <span id="blog_content"><p>Currently, there are many ways to understand the galaxy formation and evolution
process from fully hydrodynamical simulation to fully empirical statistical
models. Both models at the end of this spectra are not appropriate for
introducing this topic. In hydrodynamical simulation, we just put the most
fundamental physic law in the computer and get the result. For the empirical
model, we want to retain the statistical description to the real Universe,
without any physical insight. Between these two extrema, we have semi-analytical
modelling (SAM), which is to empirically model the individual physical process in
galaxy formation and evolution. Then we need to put all these pieces together to
get a general picture.</p>
<p>This paper is an introduction to the SAM, so it is suitable for one to start
learning the topic of galaxy formation and evolution.</p>
<h1 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h1>
<p>This review does not have many equations or quantitative description, so the
reader is not required to handle too much mathematics. Nevertheless, one need
some basic physical intuition to understand the underly process. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Why the bunch of particles which are only affected by gravitational force
will not collapse to a single point?</li>
<li>Why the electromagnetic interaction is necessary for the baryonic matter to
collapse?</li>
</ul>
<p>With basic physical concepts in mind, it should be easy to read this paper.</p>
<h1 id="why-is-it-good">Why is it good?</h1>
<h2 id="fundamental">Fundamental</h2>
<p>As I said, SAM starts from the basic physical process, so this paper also
provides explanation to all the elements from a physical viewpoint.</p>
<h2 id="clear">Clear</h2>
<p>This paper uses the most concise word to present the essence of underlying
physical process.</p>
<h2 id="comprehensive">Comprehensive</h2>
<p>Although this paper does not dig into the details of many scientific topic, it
provides many classical reference to the important topic in the field.</p>
<h1 id="last-word">Last word</h1>
<p>This paper should be your first review to read in galaxy formation and
evolution. With the general framework in mind, you can go to more advanced or
bigger material. For example,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Formation-Evolution-Houjun-Mo-ebook/dp/B00E3URATM/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=galaxy+formation+and+evolution&amp;qid=1617321057&amp;sr=8-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Galaxy Formation and Evolution</a>
is a big book to which three masters in the field devoted twenty years.</p></span>
