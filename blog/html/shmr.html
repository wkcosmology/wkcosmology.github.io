<h1 id="the-shmr-for-the-general-population">The SHMR for the general population</h1>
<p>The picture of galaxy formation within dark matter halos suggests strong
relationships between galaxies and their host dark matter halos, and the stellar
mass-halo mass relation (SHMR) is the most fundamental relation to connect
galaxies and dark matter halos. We have seen that SHMR conveys at least three
important messages about galaxy formation (see <a href="./halo_model.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this blog</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>The stellar mass-to-halo mass ratio is <strong>generally low</strong> when compared with
the universal baryonic fraction, which says that galaxies are not good at
converting baryons into stars.</li>
<li>The stellar mass-to-halo mass ratio is lower in <strong>low-mass halos</strong>, which
requires at least one additional mechanism to suppress the stellar conversion
efficiency.</li>
<li>The stellar mass-to-halo mass ratio is lower in <strong>high-mass halos</strong>, which
also requires at least one additional mechanism to suppress the efficiency
here.</li>
</ol>
<p>These results not only put stringent constraints on galaxy formation models, but
also elicit numerous efforts on the feedback effects from stellar feedback and
AGN feedback.</p>
<h1 id="the-shmr-for-star-forming-and-quiescent-galaxies">The SHMR for star-forming and quiescent galaxies</h1>
<p>Convergent observational evidence from independent studies has shown that, at a
<em>fixed stellar mass</em>, quiescent central galaxies prefer to live in more massive
halos than their star-forming counterparts. Moreover, measurements of individual
systems further confirm that, at a <em>fixed halo mass</em>, star-forming galaxies have
higher stellar mass than quiescent galaxies. In other words,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Either binned in stellar mass or halo mass, star-forming galaxies can convert
  available baryons into stars more efficiently than quiescent galaxies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When compared with state-of-the-art galaxy formation models, including one
semi-analytical model (L-GALAXIES) and three hydrodynamical simulations (TNG,
Illustris, EAGLE), we found that only the semi-analytical galaxy formation model
could reproduce the observational result while the other three hydrodynamical
simulations failed.</p>

<p>To figure out the secret of L-GALAXIES's success and all other three
simulations' failure, we further analyze the evolution history of galaxies and
their host halos. As one can see from the following figure, the average halo
growth histories are similar to each other for star-forming and quiescent
galaxies in L-GALAXIES, while, in all three hydrodynamical simulations,
quiescent galaxies prefer to live in early-formed halos. As a consequence,
L-GALAXIES can differentiate the efficiency of converting baryons into stars for
star-forming and quiescent galaxies, while galaxies in all three hydrodynamical
simulations end up with similar stellar mass and halo mass, regardless of their
star formation status.</p>

<p>We realize that the <em>key difference between L-GALAXIES and the other three
hydrodynamical simulations is <strong>how galaxy quenching is related to the assembly
history of dark matter halos</strong></em>. In L-GALAXIES, the halo assembly histories of
star-forming and quiescent galaxies are very similar to each other, which, in
other words, says that <em>the quenching of central galaxies only weakly correlates
to the halo assembly history</em> (<strong>Scenario-II</strong>). On the contrary, all other
three hydrodynamical simulations predicts <em>that quiescent galaxies profoundly
prefer early-formed halos</em> (<strong>Scenario-I</strong>). Finally, for the sake of
completeness, we also consider the case that <em>star-forming galaxies prefer
early-formed halos</em> (<strong>Scenario-III</strong>).</p>
<p>The prediction of stellar mass and halo mass evolution is shown in the following
illustrative figure. In all three scenarios, all galaxies are star-forming at
the initial stage, so their stellar mass growth is proportional to the growth of
dark matter halos, thus the total available baryons, which is a reasonable
assumption. Then, some galaxies are quenched, their stellar mass growth will be
suppressed, compared to their star-forming counterparts.</p>
<p>In <strong>Scenario-I</strong>, the progenitors of quiescent galaxies were more massive when
they are still star-forming, since these progenitors live in more massive halos.
Then, when these galaxies were quenched and got suppressed in terms of their
stellar mass growth, which allows their star-forming counterparts to catch up.
Eventually, these two populations end up with similar stellar mass, which is
<strong>disfavored</strong> by observational data.</p>
<p>In <strong>Scenario-II</strong>, since star-forming and quiescent galaxies have similar halo
assembly histories, they have similar stellar mass initially. Then, along with
the quenching of some galaxies, their stellar mass growth is suppressed and end
up with lower stellar mass, compared to their star-forming counterparts.</p>
<p>In <strong>Scenario-III</strong>, the stellar mass of those quiescent galaxies is not only
suppressed by late-time quenching, but also disadvantaged initially since their
progenitor halo mass is lower. Consequently, those quiescent galaxies end up
with lower stellar mass than their star-forming counterparts, and the difference
is even larger than <strong>Scenario-II</strong>.</p>
<p>In summary, the qualitative observational results strongly <strong>disfavor
Scenario-I</strong>, while furhter discrimination between Scenario-II and Scenario-III
requires more quantitative results.</p>
