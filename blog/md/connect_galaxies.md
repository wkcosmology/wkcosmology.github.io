# Redshift evolution and causality

Light speed is finite, so it takes finite time before we can see distant
objects. For example, it takes about eight minutes for the photon to travel from
the Sun to the Earth, so the Sun perceived by us is actually what it is like
eight minutes ago. This effect becomes more non-negligible in astronomy because
all objects that we are interested in are so distant that it may take millions
to trillions of years before we can receive the light these distant galaxies
emit.
