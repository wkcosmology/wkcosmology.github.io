# Redshift evolution and causality

Light speed is finite, so it takes finite time before we can see distant
objects. For example, it takes about eight minutes for the photon to travel from
the Sun to the Earth, so the Sun perceived by us is actually what it is like
eight minutes ago. This effect becomes more non-negligible in astronomy because
all objects that we are interested in are so distant that it may take millions
to trillions of years before we can receive the light these distant galaxies
emit.

This effect also allows us to study the evolution of our Universe and the
galaxies in it. For example, galaxies observed at $z\sim 1$ are when the
Universe is only 6 Gyr old, while the current age for our Universe is about 13.7
Gyr. Similarly, $z\sim 2$ galaxies are at the time when the Universe was 3.4 Gyr
old. Hence, by observing galaxies at different redshifts, we can get the
**statistical** evolution of galaxies as a function of cosmic time.

However, one must be aware that we can only get the statistical evolution
instead of the causal evolution, because we are actually observing **different
patches** of our Universe at different cosmic time.

# Galaxy-halo connection

Our method of connecting galaxies across cosmic time relies on the tight
correlation between galaxies and their dark matter halos, which is called the
galaxy-halo connection in literature (See [this blog](./halo_model.html) for the
physical picture).
