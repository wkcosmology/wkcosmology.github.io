# Halo formation time

The assembly of dark matter halos proceeds hierarchically, where low-mass halos
are formed early and they merge with each other to form larger halos. This
process can be described by a **halo merger tree**, which grows from the
descendant halos and splits to multiple progenitor halos recursively. This tree
structure is too complicated to be understood, nor incorporated into theoretical
modelling. Therefore, data compression is required. A conventional way is to
extract the main branch by recursively selecting the most massive progenitor,
and this main branch is also referred to as the **mass accretion history**. From
the mass accretion history, one can define a characteristic formation time as
the time that the main progenitor has accumulated half of its final mass, which
is also referred to as the **halo formation time**.

[Wang et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07189) found that _the ratio
between the stellar mass of the central galaxy and the halo mass_ is a good
observational proxy of halo formation time, where **early-formed halos tend to
more dominant central galaxies**. This relation is also found in hydrodynamical
simulations and empirical models.

# Observational evidence

First of all, there is no direct evidence of the statistical correlation between
halo formation time and the quenching of central galaxies at given halo masses
for two reasons:

-   There is no reliable halo mass estimation for individual halo for a large
    and unbiased galaxy group sample at the current stage.
-   Halo formation time is not a observable. But the central-to-total stellar
    mass ratio is a good proxy of halo formation time.

Secondly, there are several indirect observational evidences that central
galaxies in early-formed halos are more star-forming and spiral-like. For
example, [Posti et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05099) found a
population of star-forming spiral central galaxies with
$M_\*\sim 10^{11} M_\odot$ lives in $\sim 10^{12} M_\odot$ halos, where the halo
mass is obtained through the modelling of the HI rotation curve. Their results
indicate that the stellar conversion efficiency $\epsilon\equiv M_*/f_b/M_h$
achieves nearly $100\%$ in these halos. Similarly,
[Zhang et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04777) found that star-forming
central galaxies with $M_\*\sim 10^{11} M_\odot$ live in $\sim 10^{12} M_\odot$
halos with a stellar conversion efficiency of $\sim 60\%$, where the halo mass
is obtained through weak gravitational lensing and satellite kinematics.
Therefore, we are pretty sure that there is a population of star-forming spiral
galaxies in $\sim 10^{12}M_\odot$ halos with a stellar conversion efficiency
$\epsilon\gtrsim 60\%$, while a typical $10^{12}M_\odot$ halo has
$\epsilon\sim 20\%$. Combined with the result that earlier-formed halos tend to
host more massive central galaxies, we obtained that _galaxies in early-formed
halos tend to be more star-forming and spiral-like than galaxies in late-formed
halos_.

[Wang et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07189) studied the dependence of
the star formation activities and morphologies of central galaxies on the
formation time of host halos, which is indicated by the central stellar mass to
halo mass ratio. And they also found that early-formed halos tend to host
star-forming and spiral-like central galaxies compared with those late-formed
halos.

# Physical origin

Currently, there is no satisfying mechanism to explain this relation. Here I
introduce my own speculation. To begin with, early-formed halos tend to have
more concentrated mass distribution, which is well-established two decades ago
(see [Wechsler et al. 2002](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0108151)), and
concentrated halos drives the formation of galaxy disk (see
[Hopkins et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08263)). Then, the AGN feedback
is less efficient in disk galaxies, so that they are less quenched.
