                        Galaxies are born and raised in dark matter halos, so
                        they are tightly related to each other. Previous
                        research has established the primary galaxy-halo
                        connection, which is known as the
                        <strong>stellar mass-halo mass relation (SHMR)</strong>,
                        from which we infer the necessity of
                        <strong>supernovae feedback</strong> and
                        <strong>AGN feedback</strong> to suppress the conversion
                        from baryon to stars in low-mass and high-mass halos,
                        respectively. Nowadays, people start to pursue the
                        <strong>secondary galaxy-halo connection</strong>, and I
                        am one of them. The ultimate question in this regard is

                        Dark matter halos are the building blocks of our
                        Universe, and they can be characterized from three
                        perspectives:
                        <strong>The temporal dimension:</strong> the assembly of
                        dark matter halos as a function of cosmic time, which
                        can be described by halo merger trees.
                        <strong>The intra-halo dimension:</strong> the spatial
                        and kinematic structures of dark matter halos, such as
                        halo density profile, halo shape, halo spin, and
                        substructures.
                        <strong>The inter-halo dimension:</strong> the spatial
                        clustering of dark matter halos.

                    Galaxy surveys during previous decades have provided us
                    with numerous observational data, and more to expect from
                    upcoming surveys. Meanwhile, modern numerical simulations
                    of galaxy formation have greatly deepen our understanding
                    many fundamental astrophysical processes. However, the
                    observation has not reached the physics yet, nor vice
                    versa. There is a huge gap between them: we cannot
                    accurately probe many crucial components, like dark matter
                    halos, multi-phase gas, and super-massive black holes, of
                    galaxies observationally, nor do we have the ability to
                    simulate the complex astrophysical processes, like stellar
                    feedback, AGN feedback and the growth of super-massive
                    black hole, in galaxy evolution numerically. We aim to
                        build a <strong>semi-analytical galaxy formation model
                            that is motivated by various astrophysical
                            processes in hydrodynamical simulations and
                            calibrated to reproduce the statistical behavior of
                        observed galaxies</strong>. There are a lot of
                    questions to be answered by this model, and currently I am
                    focusing on the following ones:
