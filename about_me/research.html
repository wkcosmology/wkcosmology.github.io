                    <p>
                        Galaxies are born and raised in dark matter halos so we
                        expect their properties tightly correlate with the halo
                        properties. To understand the processes of galaxy
                        formation and evolution, it is crucial to build the
                        connection between the properties of galaxies and dark
                        matter halos.

                    Why do we want to connect galaxies across cosmic time?
                    <p>
                        Galaxies at different redshifts are causally irrelevant
                        but statistically connected. High-z galaxies are
                        statistical progenitors of low-z galaxies, and vice
                        versa. By connecting progenitors and descendants, we can
                        directly infer the formation and evolution of galaxies.

                    How to connect galaxies across cosmic time?
                    <p>
                        Dark matter halo merger trees describe the formation and
                        evolution of dark matter halos/subhalos as a function of
                        cosmic time. Therefore, once we connect galaxies and
                        dark matter halos at different redshifts, we can also
                        connect galaxies across cosmic time since halos at
                        different redshifts are connected through the merger
                        trees.

                    What is galaxy quenching?
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Galaxy quenching refers to the rapid fading of star
                        formation activity inside galaxies. There are many
                        physical mechanisms proposed to quench galaxies, which
                        can be broadly divided into two categories: internal
                        processes and external processes. The former comprises
                        the feedback effect from the accretion of central
                        massive black holes, the high angular momentum that
                        suppress gas infalling, the inefficient cooling of gas
                        in massive halos due to the shock heating etc. The later
                        comprises the suppression of gas accretion and the
                        stripping of the circum-galactic medium, the stripping
                        of inter-galactic medium etc.
