                        Galaxies are born and raised in dark matter halos, so
                        they are tightly correlated with each other. Previous
                        researches have established the primary galaxy-halo
                        connection, which is known as the
                        <strong>stellar mass-halo mass relation (SHMR)</strong>,
                        from which we infer the necessity of
                        <strong>supernovae feedback</strong> and
                        <strong>AGN feedback</strong> to suppress the conversion
                        from baryon to stars in low-mass and high-mass halos,
                        respectively. Nowadays, people start to pursue the
                        <strong>secondary galaxy-halo connection</strong>, and I
                        am one of them.

                        Dark matter halos are the building blocks of our
                        Universe, and they can be characterized from three
                        perspectives:
                        <strong>The temporal dimension:</strong> the assembly of
                        dark matter halos as a function of cosmic time, which
                        can be described by halo merger trees.
                        <strong>The intra-halo dimension:</strong> the spatial
                        and kinematic structures of dark matter halos, such as
                        halo density profile, halo shape, halo spin, and
                        substructures.
                        <strong>The inter-halo dimension:</strong> the spatial
                        clustering of dark matter halos.

                        Galaxy quenching refers to the transition from a active
                        star forming state to the quiescent state for galaxies.
                        Star formation is so important because the integration
                        of the star formation rate is the total stellar mass we
                        can observe in our Universe. Galaxy quenching is so
                        important because it (partially) explains why some
                        galaxies convert their baryons to stars very
                        inefficiently, or why the conversion process stops.
                        Galaxies quench due to multiple reasons, and they can be
                        empirically categorized into two types:
                        <strong> internal quenching</strong> and
                        <strong> external quenching</strong>.

                            determined by the dark matter halos they live in?
