                        Galaxies are born and raised in dark matter halos, so,
                        theoretically, their properties should be tightly
                        correlated. Thus, it is critical to infer the relation
                        between their properties from observation, and explain
                        it with physical model. <br />

                    Galaxy quenching refers to the rapid fading of star
                    formation activity inside galaxies. And satellite quenching
                    specifically refers to the quenching of satellite galaxies
                    under the impact of surrounding environment.

                Finding proto-clusters to trace galaxy evolution

                        <strong>What is proto-cluster?</strong><br />
                        Proto-cluster is the collection of galaxies, halos and
                        other material at high redshift that will enter in a
                        common massive dark matter halos. Normally, we require
                        the descendant halo mass above 10^14 solar mass.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Why is proto-cluster important?</strong><br />
                        There are two motivations:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                We want to connect galaxies across different
                                redshift to infer their evolution along with
                                cosmic time. Since proto-clusters are
                                progenitors of galaxy clusters in local
                                Universe, their detection can help us to build
                                the connection.
                            </li>

                                Galaxy observation in local Universe reveals
                                distinct properties for galaxies in field and
                                cluster environments. Thus, we need to study the
                                progenitors of local galaxy clusters
                                specifically.

                        <strong>How to find proto-clusters?</strong><br />
                        There are many detection methods proposed, each with
                        different tracer. In this project, we use the dark
                        matter halos constructed from the galaxy group finder to
                        identify proto-clusters.

                        <strong>What is galaxy group?</strong><br />
                        Galaxy group is a collection of galaxies sharing a
                        common dark matter halo.

                        <strong>Why do we want to study galaxy group?</strong
                        ><br />
                        In LCDM paradigm, galaxies are formed and evolved in
                        dark matter halos, so their properties should be tightly
                        correlated. Thus, by identifying galaxy groups in survey
                        data, we can directly build the connection between
                        galaxies and dark matter halos.

                            high redshift?</strong
                        ><br />
                        At high redshift, galaxy observation is very expensive
                        due to several reasons. For example, galaxies are
                        spatially inhomogeneous, so, high completeness in dense
                        region means a lot of wasting of fiber time in sparse
                        region. Another reason is that some galaxies at high
                        redshift do not have prominent spectral features for
                        reliable redshift calibration. All of these factors will
                        cause the incompleteness, and it will undermine the
                        galaxy group finding performance.
